# Java-Bag-Implementation
 This Java project implements a generic Bag class using a HashMap to manage collections of items where duplicates are allowed and each element's count is tracked. The class provides functionalities to add, remove, check the presence of items, and retrieve the count of any item, demonstrating key concepts of data structure management in Java.
